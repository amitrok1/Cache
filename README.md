# Thetaray Cache Test
____
## Preview

An LRU (Least recently used) cache - keeps most updated objects in memory and evicts oldest items considering cache capacity.
This cache uses LinkedHashMap which operates exactly in this way.

## What do you need to do in this test?
1. Implement LruHashMap.getEldestEntry - get the oldest entry in the linked hash-map
2. Implement LruCache.get LruCache.put and LruCache.remove
3. Run all tests under LruCacheTest successfully

You can only use java docs..
