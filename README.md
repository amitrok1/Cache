# Thetaray Cache Test
____
## Preview

An LRU (Least recently used) cache - keeps most updated objects in memory and evicts oldest items considering cache capacity.
This cache uses LinkedHashMap which operates exactly in this way.

## What do you need to do in this test?
1. Clone the repository and create a new branch.  branch name should be your full name
2. Implement LruHashMap.getEldestEntry - get the oldest entry in the linked hash-map
3. Implement LruCache.get LruCache.put and LruCache.remove
4. Run all tests under LruCacheTest successfully

You can only use java docs, no googling.
